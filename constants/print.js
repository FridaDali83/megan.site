Every year SSPC has sent out a bland, 8.5x11 magazine to their past guests and it usually doesn't get much impact. So when I sat down to design this guide, I decided to make something different. First I decided to change the shape, it's an 8x8 sqaure, and then I chose to make the design more modern by using monochromatic colors, bold font and a light frame to pull the viewers gaze to the center of the cover. I also changed the order of the guide, used bigger font and colored coded each day so that it's more organized. After recieving their preliminary guide in the mail, a lot of people thanked me for making the guide easier to follow and praised me on the modern design.",
