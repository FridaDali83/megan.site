When I was asked to design a sign for a big welcome reception party at the SSPC annual conference that encompasses the New Orleans vibe, the first things that came to mind were jazz and Bourban Street. What is more representing of a party in New Orleans than Bourban Street? The answer, nothing.</p><p> So I did some research on vintage art in the New Orleans area and decided to create my own version of an abstract painting of night life on Bourban Street. When I showed this piece to my team, they were thrilled with the outcome because it was so different from anything else I've ever done.</p> <p>This image was used digitally on monitors throughout the venue and was also printed and placed outside of the reception hall.</p>",
